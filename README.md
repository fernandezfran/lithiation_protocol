# Lithiation of amorphous silicon

Slightly similar Chevrier and Dahn protocol for lithiation of a-Si.

I only consider the first two steps:
1. add a Li atom at the center of the largest spherical void,
2. increase the volume and scale the coordinates,
the rest (volume minimization, energy, etc.) are replaced by a NPT simulation.

the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1149/1.3111037) where the protocol is established.
